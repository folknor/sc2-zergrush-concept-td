# sc2-zergrush-concept-td
Old Starcraft 2 map concept I made. A tower defense / hero defense type map made mostly in galaxyscript.

Essentially, for any would-be-mappers out there, the map offers a few things you can learn from:
* TD waves are defined in UserData, and are quite dynamic and easy to work with
* Almost everything is written in pure galaxy script, and the code should be easy enough to follow
* Some of what is in galaxyscript now should actually be done through the data editor or trigger editor instead, like the unit changes and some of the map setup
* The code can mostly be taken and dumped into a new terrain without changing much

I only uploaded it here as a reference, but if anyone wants to flesh out the map and make it playable, that would of course be excellent.

Just ask, and I'll add you to the repository. Or fork it at will. You may also rename the map entirely, the name is just a placeholder, mostly.

All screenshots are taken with the lowest graphics settings possible.
